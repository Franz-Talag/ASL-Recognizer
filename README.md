# ASL-Recognizer
<h3>Codes for ASL recognition Machine Learning</h3>
Here are the necessary codes for the program. Download everything and make sure to run it on Python 3.10 or 3.9, you can use ".venv" so you don't have to uninstall your Python 3.13. Download all of the necessary libraries. 
You have to run "create_background" first so the data that you are going to generate will have a white background. <br>
Then run the "Data-Collector" to collect data for the machine learning. 
PS: This program is still not working. I've encountered an error on "Model-Trainer.py" I still have to import "cv2". I haven't tested anything if it works. I still have to Train my AI, after training the machine, I can then use it in real time.
